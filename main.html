	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<!-- Paragraph 1: Time Complexity -->
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. An algorithm with better time complexity is more efficient and can handle larger inputs faster.</p>

	<!-- Paragraph 2: Space Complexity -->
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run to completion. For example, if an algorithm uses an array of size n, we say it has a space complexity of O(n).</p>
